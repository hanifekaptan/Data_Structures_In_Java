# Data Structures
This project contains notes on various data structures implemented in Java. Below are the descriptions of each data structure.

## 1. Stack

A stack is a data structure based on the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used in function calls, undo operations, and similar scenarios.

## 2. Queue

A queue is a data structure based on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed. Queues are often used in task management and data flow control.

## 3. Circular Queue

A circular queue is a variant of the queue structure. It stores elements in a circular array, which improves space efficiency.

## 4. Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a data structure where each node contains a reference to the next node. It is useful for dynamic data insertion and deletion operations.

## 5. Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains references to both the next and the previous nodes. This structure allows access to elements in both directions.
